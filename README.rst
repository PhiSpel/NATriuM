NATriuM is a high-order finite element lattice Boltzmann solver
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It features 2D and 3D unstructured grids and provides two streaming techniques:

* Spectral-element discontinous Galerkin (SEDG), originally by Min and Lee
* Semi-Lagrangian streaming, by Kr√§mer et al.
