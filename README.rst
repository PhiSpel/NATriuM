NATriuM is a high-order finite element lattice Boltzmann solver based on deal.ii
----------------------------------------------------------------------



It features 2D and 3D unstructured grids and provides two streaming techniques:

* Spectral-element discontinous Galerkin (SEDG), originally by Min and Lee
* Semi-Lagrangian streaming, by Kr√§mer et al.

Regime: 

* Fully compressible viscous flows
* Weakly compressible viscous flows

Test cases:

* (Compressible) Taylor-Green vortex 2D and 3D
* Shock tube 1D
* Riemann problem 2D
* Shock-vortex interaction 2D
