CFL = 1
Refinement Level = 3
periodic: Taylor-Green Vortex (as usual with L=2PI)
wall: Couette Flow with U = 1/2PI 
pseudospectrum with perturbation = 0.1

..._p2 -> Order of FE = 2
..._p2 -> Order of FE = 3


For plot_spectrum_p3.eps:
- The bigger region of eigenvalues comes from the calculation of the CFL number
  which assumes equidistant intervals. The dofs however do not reside in equidistant
  vertices, but on GLL points. Through applying a corrected CFL number
  
  CFL = dt * U / min(dx)
  
  the eigenvalues will be roughly in the same region as before.
